It's a python project with the extensive use of tkinter.The main objective of the project is to help the user to experience an online travel ticket reservation portal. The user has to select various preferences from the given choices. A backend CSV file is created which contains the data that a user has selected.

Features of the project
 Software completely made in ‘Python’ only.
 Use of TKINTER MODULE.

registration of travel ticket.
 Options like Reset,Exit,Submit the data are

 Data entered in the application directly adds it in a
csv file (submit button has to be pressed for that).

 Calculation of total cost takes place by adding all the
taxes,multiplication with the number of users entered
and also the option of a single or return ticket.
 Dialog box immediately appears if correct data is not
